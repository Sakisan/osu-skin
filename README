Skin for a rythm game called osu!

The game's website: https://osu.ppy.sh/
The skin's latest version: https://github.com/Sakisan/osu-skin

I don't include hitsounds for now.
I suggest you add those you're used to when using this skin.

I also suggest not to dim the background of the beatmaps ~

A good map to test any skin
